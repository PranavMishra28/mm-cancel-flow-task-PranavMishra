## 🔄 Routing & State Management

### State Architecture

```typescript
type CancelState = {
  step: StepId;
  cancellationId?: string;
  variant?: Variant;
  planPriceCents?: number;
  found_job?: boolean;
  found_via_migratemate?: boolean;
  employer_immigration_support?: "yes" | "no";
  visa_type?: string;
};
```

### Step Flow Management

```typescript
type StepId =
  | "S0"
  | "J1"
  | "J2"
  | "J3"
  | "J3_LAWYER_YES"
  | "YES_COMPLETION_VISA_HELP"
  | "D1"
  | "N1"
  | "N2"
  | "N3"
  | "COMPLETED"
  | "STILL_LOOKING_OFFER"
  | "STILL_LOOKING_OFFER_ACCEPTED"
  | "STILL_LOOKING_ROLES_PREVIEW"
  | "STILL_LOOKING_USAGE_SURVEY"
  | "STILL_LOOKING_REASONS"
  | "CANCEL_COMPLETED_GENERIC";
```

### Navigation Logic

- **Forward navigation**: Based on user choices and validation
- **Backward navigation**: Preserves user input and form state
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks with user feedback
- **State persistence**: Maintains data across navigation

### API Integration

- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based security for all requests
- **Graceful Degradation**: Demo mode when API fails
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive logging without user disruption
- **Data Persistence**: Automatic saving at each step

---

## ✅ Validation & Error Handling

### Input Validation Systems

**Currency Validation** (Too Expensive):

```typescript
const validatePrice = (value: string): boolean => {
  const cleanValue = value.replace(/^\$/, "").replace(/,/g, "").trim();
  const numValue = parseFloat(cleanValue);
  return (
    !isNaN(numValue) &&
    numValue >= 0 &&
    numValue <= 999.99 &&
    /^\d+(\.\d{0,2})?$/.test(cleanValue)
  );
};
```

**Text Validation** (Feedback Responses):

- Minimum 25 characters required
- Real-time character counting
- Instant error clearing on valid input
- Auto-scroll to invalid fields

### Error Display Patterns

- **Immediate feedback**: Errors show on attempted submission
- **Real-time clearing**: Errors disappear as user corrects input
- **Visual indicators**: Red rings and error text for invalid fields
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes for screen readers

### API Error Handling

- **Network failures**: Graceful logging without user disruption
- **Server errors**: Detailed logging for debugging
- **Fallback modes**: Demo mode when APIs unavailable
